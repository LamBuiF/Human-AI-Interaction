# Human-AI-Interaction
The project aims to predict a person's response to AI, particularly how trustworthy they think the AI is based on the AI's answers to various prompts.

The repository is separated into Python files used to organize data and train machine learning models to predict subjects' responses, and the result files in form of .csv files.
The data files used for training is located in the Data, New Data, and conditionsFile folders.
Other files outside the afformentioned folders are result files or script files, with the latest files having the largest number (before the _00x, which is used to determine which subject's data is used for the file).
